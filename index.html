<!-- 
When Browser requests a web page, it downloads HTML first of all, which gives it reference of other Resources
That HTML is then parsed line by line to see what needs to be done if any download required or not
DOM is not ready yet, It will be parsed and in process it will be built gradually adding elements one-by-one
if the line is <script> it runs it
if line is .css src of js, it downloads it and that blocks Ur parsing of DOM, so thats why they say keep it down so that UI is visible by that time and usually JS acts on DOM , which is ready only when it reaches </body>
Idea is dont keep HEAVY JS at top, because use never get to see UI asap
Though it changes as it loads

CSS is at top , if u keep it at bottom, it will Be like BLANK COLORLESS HTML and then when CSS downloads and COLOR begins to appear.
You dont want that !!!!!

See Below example where i have kept a Image and a alert box to show you that It loads and shows as soon as its added or more or less so.

Same is Case is <H1> Tag Which gets added to DOM and Displayed only when 

window.onload is when all downloads is done.
document.onReady is when Browser has Made Full DOM or you can say Full <body element>
JS can act on HTML elements or DOM elements for behavior or some animation - event Driven
No need to download them first and blocking UI.

if U try to refer document.getElementById(AnHTMLTag which we have not added in DOM encountered yet)
it gives error.
So usually why we keep $.onready() because brower knows When it has parsed full DOM, <body>
so, it starts early - rather than waiting for all images to be loaded.

    Gives Uncaught TypeError : Cannot read property 'innerHTML' of null
    because H1 is not loaded yet or we have not encountered it yet.
    document.getElementById is OK
    document.getelementBYidis not OK - JS is case sensitive, Html is not case sensitive

    <script src="prat.js"></script>
    <!--I kept it deliberately because we see load time increases when i keep it there, Its better down at the end of body when it parses full dom dynamically at least DOM is visible by then
    thats why it is advisable to keep heavy JS Files down because usually
